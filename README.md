# Why the name ?

I needed a name for my project and this week in Denver we're about to get hit with this winter storm:

According to the description:

_What's a "bomb cyclone"?
A bomb cyclone is a real meteorological term. Bombogenesis is when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies 24 mb in 24 hours. This storm does have that potential! I personally don't love this term because it can get sensationalized on social media, but it is technically accurate and certainly looks likely with storm._

I thought it was a pretty sweet term so used it for my project.
